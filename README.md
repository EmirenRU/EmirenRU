## Hello, World!

Hey, there! I am Emil Yusupov, mostly geek in using Java, but want to try Rust. Through situation, while I did not wanted to know js, I learned it too... 
Through using VPS by cloudzy mostly, I use it to host my apps, and e.t.c. Now, I need to learn AWS.
Sometimes, I can try to improvise in C++ or Python, because I tried to do a game engine, but it was unfortunate forgotten, and some scripting or researching.
